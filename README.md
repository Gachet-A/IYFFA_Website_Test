# IYFFA System Testing

Welcome to the IYFFA System Testing Repository. This repository includes comprehensive tests designed to validate the entire system's functionality, including authentication, front-end and back-end integration, and other critical workflows.

## Project Overview

This repository is focused on performing extensive tests that involve multiple components of the IYFFA system. The tests are primarily manual but offer scripts or guidance for executing tests that validate the system's behavior.

## Testing Objectives

- **Authentication Flows**: Verify that user authentication processes are working as expected.
- **Front-end and Back-end Integration**: Ensure seamless data exchange and functionality between the user interface and server-side logic.
- **System Workflows**: Test complete processes from end to end to ensure that all system components work together as expected.
